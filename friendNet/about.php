<h2 style='padding: 0px !important; font-size: 24px;'>About friendNet</h2>
<hr /><br />
<h3>What's this site all about?</h3>
<p style='font-size:14px;'>This is a social networking site, as you could guess. It's based around interaction between old friends and new friends you make here.</p>
<br />
<h3>How's it coming?</h3>
<p style='font-size:14px;'>This website is far from complete, but I'm slowly making progress to help this site be user-friendly and fun to use.</p>
<br />
<h3>What's a "Niche"?</h3>
<p style='font-size:14px;'>A niche (at least on this site) is a space for you and whoever you want. Share photos, videos, quotes, and text with whoever you want to.</p>
<br />
<h3>Why should I use this rather than Facebook or Twitter?</h3>
<br />
<li style='font-size:14px; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 5px;'>Community. Unlike on other sites, on friendNet we try to enforce a sense of community and safety.</li>
<li style='font-size:14px; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 5px;'>Niches. This friendNet exclusive feature allows you to interact online like never before.</li>
<li style='font-size:14px; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 5px;'>No censorship. We believe that the 1st amendment should apply online as well, and thus are giving free speech to all of our users (Just don't push it).</li>
<li style='font-size:14px; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 5px;'>Ad-free. Other sites like Facebook have sneaky ways of prying money from their users. However, friendNet is a completely non-profit website.</li>
<li style='font-size:14px; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 5px;'>Open-source. Nothing to hide here, folks! All of you beginner web developers like me may learn a thing or two from my code. Find it <a href='#' style='font-size:14px;'>here</a>.</li>
<br />
<h3>Who made this?</h3>
<p style='font-size:14px;'>friendNet was dreamt up by, coded by, and is managed by aspiring high school web and game developer <a href="./Connorbub" style='font-size:14px;'>Connor Young</a>.</p>
<br />
